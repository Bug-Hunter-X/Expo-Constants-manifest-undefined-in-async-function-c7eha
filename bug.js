This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.manifest` object within an async function before the app is fully initialized.  Accessing `Constants.manifest` too early results in undefined values or errors, especially when accessing properties like `bundleIdentifier` or `version`.  The problem is that the `Constants.manifest` object is populated asynchronously; it's not immediately available after the app starts.
